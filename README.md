# Heat-conduction-problem-in-two-dimensions
Project realised during course: FEM and BEM in technique. Scripts contain problems of generating mesh, applying boundary conditions, agregation of matrices and presentation of results.

Used libraries:
 - numpy
 - sympy
 - matplotlib

Differential equation solved with Galerking FEM method. Shape function determined by interpolation to nodes values with Vandermonde matrix.
